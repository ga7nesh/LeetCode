# Description

LeetCode is one of the most well-known online judge platforms that you can use to practice your programming skills by solving coding questions. It has over 1,100 different problems, support for over 18 programming languages, and an active community that is always there to help you with the solutions you come up with. If your intention is to hone your coding skills, then this online judge platform is one of the best that you can use.

Most of LeetCode’s content is free, but LeetCode Premium enhances all of its positives by granting you access to things like access to premium problems and solutions, access to a built-in debugger, an autocomplete function, and interview simulations with feedback. It also makes it even more effective if you’re using it to prepare for technical interviews, as it grants you access to company-specific programming questions that you can use to have a better grasp of what you can expect from the questions you’ll face in interviews with companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, making it the ideal online judge to use if your sights are set on one of these FAANG companies.

However, as a tool for interview preparation, it’s lacking in certain areas. One of the cons that LeetCode has is that, while you can see the solution to problems, they don’t have an in-depth explanation of the DS&A/systems design concepts you’re using to solve these programming questions, which is a crucial part of the learning process.
